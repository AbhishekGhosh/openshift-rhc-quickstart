h1. A quickstart to the OpenShift command line client tools (rhc)

OpenShift is a cloud platform which allows the deployment and scaling of apps written in Java PHP Ruby Python Perl, provides continuous integration testing tools (Jenkins) and also offers MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite as storage options; it's definitely an interesting range of tools.

The deployments can be controlled via a REST api or the rhc command line tool. This short guide aims at helping the newcomers to get started quickly with rhc.

h2. Installation

There is a YUM repo available for Fedora and RHEL systems, but rhc is a Ruby gem and it means you can install it with gem once your gems build environment is setup properly.

pre. $ gem install rhc

h2. Create a domain

You should have already created an account on OpenShift, if you haven't yet, please do.Then let's create our domain. This is a namespace binded to your username and will affect the apps url, which will look like $APPNAME-$DOMAIN.rhcloud.com

pre. $ rhc domain create -l $USERNAME -n $NAMESPACE

h2. Create an app

Very simple step needed to create an app inside the namespace defining some of its peculiarities.

pre. $ rhc app create -l $USERNAME -a $APPNAME -t ruby-1.8

This will create an app of type ruby-1.8 called $APPNAME, but other types can be used:

pre.
raw-0.1, php-5.3, jbossas-7.0,
jenkins-1.4, python-2.6, perl-5.10, ruby-1.8

Here is a complete list of commands you can use to control your app

<pre>
create       Bind a registered rhcloud user to a domain in rhcloud.
show         Display information about a user
start        Starts the application (includes embedded)
stop         Stops the application (includes embedded)
force-stop   Stops all application processes
restart      Restart the application
reload       Reloads application configuration
status       Returns application status
destroy      Destroys the application
tidy         Garbage collects the git repo and empties log/tmp dirs
add-alias    Add a custom domain name for the application
remove-alias Remove a custom domain name for the application
threaddump   Trigger a thread dump for jbossas applications
tail         Tail the logs of an application
snapshot     [save|restore]  Saves/Restores an application snapshot to/from a tarball at the location specified using --filepath (default: ./$APPNAME.tar.gz)
cartridge    ACTION          Manage an embedded cartridge
</pre>

We'll get back on tail and snapshot later.

h2. Adding cartridges (eg. a database or cron)

This is needed to add support for a specific feature to your app. We are adding here the mysql-5.1 cartridge.

pre. $ rhc app cartridge add -c mysql-5.1 -a $APPNAME -l $USERNAME

Here is a list of available cartridges (as of 24/03/2012)

pre.
postgresql-8.4, metrics-0.1, mysql-5.1, jenkins-client-1.4,
10gen-mms-agent-0.1, phpmyadmin-3.4, rockmongo-1.1, cron-1.4, mongodb-2.0

h2. Using rhc from another (additional) client

A very common need is to access the same account from different workstations, in this case you'll have to add the user's public SSH keys to the account.

pre. $ rhc sshkey add -k /path/to/key.pub -i $NAME -l $USERNAME

$NAME is a general identifier. You can customize which is the default SSH key to be used by rhc in its config file.

<pre>
$ cat ~/.openshift/express.conf 
# SSH key file
#ssh_key_file = 'libra_id_rsa'
# Default rhlogin to use if none is specified
#default_rhlogin=$USERNAME
</pre>

h2. Troubleshooting your app

Two very powerful commands allow you to tail log files and to create local copies of the entire workspace where your app is running into remotely.

pre. $ rhc tail -a $APPNAME  -l $USERNAME -f $APPNAME/logs/*

This executes the regular tail command on the target host, copying back the output. You can use any other tail option passing the -i argument.

Finally you can get a snapshot of the working environment to look, for example, at custom files or even the execution environment variables.

<pre>
$ rhc snapshot save -a $APPNAME -l $USERNAME

$ tar xzf $APPNAME.tar.gz

$ ls $APPID/.env/
OPENSHIFT_APP_CTL_SCRIPT
OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME
OPENSHIFT_CONTAINER_UUID
OPENSHIFT_INTERNAL_IP
OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR
PATH
OPENSHIFT_APP_DIR
OPENSHIFT_APP_TYPE
OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR
OPENSHIFT_INTERNAL_PORT
OPENSHIFT_RUN_DIR
OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS
OPENSHIFT_APP_UUID
OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR
OPENSHIFT_LOG_DIR
OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR

$ cat $APPID/.env/OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR 
export OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR='/var/lib/libra/0f5c99f17db74cf3a93edcf330401208/hellotornado/data/
</pre>

h2. Notes

The tools are quite easy to manage and can be updated easily with a gem update. There are also a lot of other interesting features you may want to look at, like the port forwarding but this was just a quickstart intended to provide a short reference. One last note before closing: you can SSH into your system!

<pre>
$ rhc-domain-info -l $USERNAME

    Welcome to OpenShift shell

    This shell will assist you in managing openshift applications.

    !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!
    Shell access is quite powerful and it is possible for you to
    accidentally damage your application.  Procede with care!
    If worse comes to worse, destroy your application with rhc-ctl-app
    and recreate it
    !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!! IMPORTANT !!!

    type "help" for more info.

Lot of fun there, these are Xeon CPUs with few Gigs of RAM. Enjoy!
